# News Site

The assignemnt was to build a news site using the tools provided on the technigo site.

What I decided to do was a news page but for dogs. My thought process was: silly fun content in a serious news format.  

## The problem


Problem #1 (and its a big'n)
I jumped the gun and started coding before I had read all requirements and how
I should fork the already existing files from Technigo on github. 
This caused me to fail the assignment as I have not used Flexbox and only used the grid mechanics. I spent way too much time reasearching and coding JavaScript even though it wasnt part of the assigment. And ive spent countless of hours on youtube videos that might not have been necessary at this point. 
How did I fix it? Well to be fair I didnt, I had no time so I forked the files and copied my project into this one. 

Problem #2
Layout. It took me more time then I care to admit to understand how to properly adjust my content in the grid for the responsive design.
Solution: once you understand mediaquary it's quite simple even though im fairly certain that my code is pretty simplistic. I just gave the content I wanted to move an own class and targeted it within the proper mediaquary. The inspect function seeing the grid was really useful. 

About technologies im not so sure yet, I started following a youtube channel that mentions "pseudo-commands"? And it seemed really useful although I dont understand it yet. 

If I had more time id certainly use flexbox and will research it more this week before the class starts.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
